# Worm

Worm is a small and simple alternative to MS Word. It allows you to create simple documents with basic formatting options. It uses Markdown as a format for saving documents. It's more like a notes application than a full-fledged word processor.

- uses the Milkdown Markdown editor
- uses Fleabox for storage and hosting
- supports basic text formatting (bold, italic, underline, lists, headings)
- supports images
- each document is saved in a separate folder
- the document folder includes the Markdown file and any images used in the document

- the main page shows a preview of all documents with their titles and first few lines
- clicking on a document opens it in the editor
- clicking save saves the document to Fleabox
