# Building Apps on Fleabox

Fleabox is a tiny self-hosted application hub. It serves static web apps and stores per-user data as JSON files on the filesystem.

## How It Works

- Apps are static HTML/CSS/JS files in `/srv/fleabox/<app-id>/`
- User data is stored in `~/.local/share/fleabox/<app-id>/data/`
- Authentication is automatic - when you visit an app, a token is set in your cookies
- All data operations use simple REST endpoints

## API Operations

### GET - Read Data

Read a JSON file:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/api/<app-id>/data/todos.json`);
```

List directory contents:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/api/<app-id>/data/`);
const entries = await response.json();
// Returns: [{ name: "file.json", type: "file", size: 1234, mtime: 1234567890 }, ...]
```

### PUT - Write Data

Save a JSON file:
```javascript
await fetch(`/api/<app-id>/data/todos.json`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(todos)
});
```

Parent directories are created automatically. Maximum size: 10MB.

### DELETE - Remove Data

Delete a file:
```javascript
await fetch(`/api/<app-id>/data/todos.json`, {
    method: 'DELETE'
});
```

Delete a directory recursively:
```javascript
await fetch(`/api/<app-id>/data/archive?recursive=true`, {
    method: 'DELETE'
});
```


## Running Fleabox

Development mode (no authentication required):
```bash
fleabox --dev --apps-dir ./my-apps
```

Production mode:
```bash
fleabox
```

Apps are served at `http://localhost:3000/<app-id>/`
